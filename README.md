# Stone Age Factorio
This Factorio mod introduces a new "Stone Age" stage before the burner / electricity stage. It doesn't lock any technology, and there is no additional research. It's just that you start the game without any materials, and you need specific tools to mine resources. So the only way to get that sweet, sweet iron axe and progress to the "iron age", is to make increasingly complex tools that let you mine more and more materials. This provides a good fifteen minutes of extra content before you progress to burner miners.

## Tips
* Stone Age Factorio is centered around tool use. Which tool you currently have equiped determines what resources you can mine, and what those resources yield.
* Your goal is building an iron axe: that will let you mine every ore, rocks, etc..
* Some of the game mechanics are somewhat different from how Factorio usually works. Keep an eye on item descriptions.
* You can't use items in your equipment slot as ingredients. Take them out temporarily to craft.
* Once you clear the Stone Age, keep a backup iron axe in a chest in case your current axe wears out and you don't have the materials to make another one.
* Stone Age technology breaks easily: always make more than one so you don't have to start from scratch if something wears out.
* Many of the items you make out of wood can be burned as fuel once you're done with them.

## Why?
I like how vanilla Factorio's early game differs drastically from the rest in terms of gameplay. In stead of designing builds, you're running around hand-filling burner miners and smelters. Raw products like iron and copper plates are more something to achieve in small batches than continuous capacities to scale up. That's not to say that I would want to spend hours hand-crafting and baby-sitting miners, but I like the variation.

I want to extend this early stage and add even more variation in gameplay. The goal is to add a stage that comes before burner miners, with gameplay distinctly different from vanilla early game. Specifically, it should be even harder: I want your first iron-axe and your first burner-miner to feel like as much an achievement as your first assembler.

## Status
The mod is still in alpha while gameplay is being tested and changed. Once the gameplay is  ironed out more, and the placeholder graphics and sounds have been replaced with original  content, the mod will be released on the mod portal.

### Known issues
* When mining iron or stone ore with a primitive tool, a text like "+1 stone (0)" will briefly show up. This is a workaround for an API issue that [will be fixed in 0.17](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=62285).
* Some buildings need only a token burnable item in their fuel slots. These buildings are actually supposed to be unpowered, but this isn't supported by the API yet. This also [will be fixed in 0.17](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=61239).

## Want to help?
Great! I'm currently recruiting alpha testers: just add a comment on [this issue](https://github.com/StoneAgeFactorio/StoneAgeFactorio/issues/4) if you'd like to play-test this mod.

I'm also looking for help with creating original graphics and sounds for the mod. If you'd like to help with that, please send me a message.
